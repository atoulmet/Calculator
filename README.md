# Make a calculator!
*Consider all the lines in italic are bonus features. You can do it for fun but they are not required :)*

### :art: Expected UI
We expect the following components for our app

- **The action buttons**  

[A] 1 button "C" to clear the current compute  
[B] 1 button "=" to get the result of the current compute. Output: [=]

- **The compute buttons**  

[C] 10 buttons matching with the digits from 0 to 9. Output: [0-9]  
[D] 1 button "." to define a comma for floating numbers. Output: [.]  
[E] 4 buttons matching with the operators + - / x. Output: [+-/x]

- **The output buttons**  

[F] 1 label to display the current operation  
[G] 1 label to display the current result

- ***The admin buttons***  

*[H] 1 button "list"*  
*[I] 1 input to make a search*  
*[J] 1 div to display a list*

### :gear: Expected features

:one: As a user, when I press on a compute button, I should see [F] updated with the matching value  
:two: As a user, when I press on [B], I should see the right result on [G] for the current compute displayed on [F]. If the compute is not achievable, I should see a label "error" on [G]  
:three: As a user, when I press [A], I should see [F] and [G] empty.  
:four: As a developer, when I press SPACE, I should see random computes achieved as if hundreds of monkeys were using the calculator at the same time but with real computes (no error made).

:five: *As an admin, when I press [H] I should see the list of all the past computes on [J]*  
:six: *As an admin, when I fill in [I] and I press ENTER, I should see the list of results matching the search on [J].*

### :white_check_mark: Instructions

- Create a new repo on your personal GitHub (up to you for the name)
:warning: As this repo is a shared resource for candidates, please **do not fork** directly this repo  
- Create a branch to start the challenge Â 
- Create a local pull request with this branch on your repo  
- When you're done, ping us to let us know the PR is ready for review. We'll get back to you quickly :)  

:warning: Please use **React/redux** as a stack base, you're free to use anything else for the challenge  
:warning: Please remember no fork will be allowed

### General guideline  
- Remember to keep things simple
- To stay reactive and fast in our process, we'd like to avoid getting challenge's result after a 1-week delay. 
- If you can't move forward for any reason, let us know quickly to arrange things best.
- We'll arrange a meeting to make a challenge review to speak about how you achieved it.  
---> We prefer a good communication over perfect skills.
